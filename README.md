# Calculator
This is a simple calculator project built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal of this project is to create a fully functional calculator that can handle basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — and style it to resemble Apple's native iOS calculator.

## Project Goals

- Build a calculator using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- Handle standard operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
- Ensure proper input handling (e.g., preventing multiple decimals, clearing/resetting display)
- Replicate the **look and feel** of the Apple calculator

## Features

- Number input via on-screen buttons
- Operation chaining and evaluation
- Responsive design
- Clean, Apple-style calculator UI
- Keyboard input support (optional bonus)


## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – for structure  
- **CSS** – for layout and Apple-style theming  
- **JavaScript** – for logic and user interaction

## Setup

To use the calculator locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-project.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

No dependencies needed — it’s a simple static site.

## Lessons Learned

- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Managing application state
- Layout with Flexbox
- Replicating UI from a real-world application
